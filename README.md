Instructions for using the code:   
1. Start the jupyter notebook server  
2. Open Annotation Tool__Flood Regions notebook and Annotation Tool__Dry Regions notebook in 2 different tabs  
3. Provide path to input data and output path and start the annotation. The annotation can be done back and forth between the 2 notebooks until complete
